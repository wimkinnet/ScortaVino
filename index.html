              <p>Pinot Noir is a red grape variety that is part of the Pinot wine family that includes Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Meunier. This grape variety is most closely associated with France’s Burgundy wine region, which is renowned for its widely varying terroir. That means that Pinot Noir wines created in two different villages in Burgundy, even if separated by only a mile, may differ widely.</p>
